# AirBnB_clone
This is a repository that uses cmd module Console as its frontend, Python Object-Oriented Programming as its backend and the json module as the database.

## Description of the Project
This is the AirBnB clone project first part. This project mainly dwells on the backend and is interfaced with a console.

## Description of the Command Intepreter
 The command Intepreter is similar to a Bash Shell but with several limitations. The command line Intepreter serves as the web app Frontend, while the Backend uses the Python Object Oriented Programming. Examples of the commands are create, update, count, destroy e.t.c

## How To Start It
- Clone your repository from your Github Account i.e The AirBnB
- Create files as instructed from the ALX intranet.. Files such as consol.py, models e.t.c (NOTE: Write the required codes into this files to enable functionality of the web app).

## How To Use it
 This can work either in an Interactive Way or a Non-Interactive Way
